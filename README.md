Customer Performance:
This page shows the insights drawn from the customer’s data. The total number of customers 
is 48 in which 4 customers are new (acquired in 2022). Out of these 4 customers there is 1 
customer with customer ID – 47 which has no data in transaction table which means this customer 
did not participate in any transaction after joining the company. CustomerID-4 performs the best in 
term of total sales and Profit.
In this page the bar-line graph between Range of year and profit shows that the total profit generated 
by the customers who are with the company from the last 5 years is highest and the older customers 
generate lesser “total Profit”. But the table to the right-upper side shows that average profit generated 
by each customer in that “Range of year” is higher for older customers than newer.
Thus, the total profit generated by newer customers is high because the number of customers 
in that range is higher than in the older range of year
